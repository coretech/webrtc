 * Audio sample formats
 *
 * - The data described by the sample format is always in native-endian order.
 *   Sample values can be expressed by native C types, hence the lack of a signed
 *   24-bit sample format even though it is a common raw audio data format.
 *
 * - The floating-point formats are based on full volume being in the range
 *   [-1.0, 1.0]. Any values outside this range are beyond full volume level.
 *
 * - The data layout as used in av_samples_fill_arrays() and elsewhere in FFmpeg
 *   (such as AVFrame in libavcodec) is as follows:
 *
 * @par
 * For planar sample formats, each audio channel is in a separate data plane,
 * and linesize is the buffer size, in bytes, for a single plane. All data
 * planes must be the same size. For packed sample formats, only the first data
 * plane is used, and samples for each channel are interleaved. In this case,
 * linesize is the buffer size, in bytes, for the 1 plane.
